export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm Akash Patankar, a passionate and self-taught frontend developer with a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. As a fresher, I’ve built responsive portfolios and multi-page websites focused on clean design, performance, and user experience. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, visually appealing web interfaces and continuously work to improve my skills. I'm excited to contribute to real-world projects and grow as a developer.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I’m someone who genuinely enjoys the process of creating—whether it’s designing a smooth user interface or solving layout challenges with clean, efficient code. My interest in web development comes from a curiosity about how things work and a desire to make digital experiences better for users. I believe that good frontend development is a balance of creativity, logic, and attention to detail, and that’s exactly where I find myself most engaged. I’m always looking for ways to improve, whether that’s learning a new technique, exploring better coding practices, or understanding how users interact with interfaces. I work well both independently and as part of a team, and I value clear communication and shared growth. For me, being a frontend developer isn’t just about building websites—it’s about crafting thoughtful experiences that are fast, accessible, and enjoyable to use.`;
